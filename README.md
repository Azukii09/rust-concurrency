# Rust Concurrency

This repository, available at [https://github.com/Azukii09/rust-concurrency](https://github.com/Azukii09/rust-concurrency), is created solely for educational purposes. Its primary focus is to explore and learn about concurrency in Rust and its various implementation techniques.

## About

This repository contains projects, examples, and code samples that dive into the world of concurrency in Rust. Through hands-on experiments and practical examples, the goal is to understand how Rust handles multi-threading, asynchronous programming, and various concurrency primitives.

## Repository Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for various concurrency examples.
- **examples/**: Includes standalone examples and code snippets demonstrating different concurrency patterns in Rust.
- **README.md**: This file, which explains the purpose and usage of the repository.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a solid understanding of Rustâ€™s concurrency model.
- Explore multi-threading and asynchronous programming in Rust.
- Learn to implement and manage concurrent tasks effectively.
- Experiment with various concurrency primitives and patterns provided by Rust.
